# Algorithms-Csharp
The whole repository contains simple implemantations of C# algorithms, each of them stored in a separate .cs files.
Some of them during my studies, other being exersices encountered during job interviews/videos about those and the rest created out of a curiosity.
Please bear in mind that these were my first C# try-outs, so do not expect the code to be particuarly clean ;)

All of these are console applications, with just one, Program.cs class:

1. ArraySumRecurrency - Recursive function that sums up all the values in an array.

2. BinarySearch - This implemantation searches through an array (binary search) and returns to the user index value of the searched number. 
This particular console app:
a) lets you choose if you would like to create an array yourself or have a randomly generated one
b) presents you the array, sorts it and presents you sorted array again
c) Returns index of the searched value
(sort of "spagetthi code", since everything is stored in one Program.cs class)

3. Simple factorial calculation

4. Map Exersice that I encountered during one of my job interviews. This was the way I solved it back then, not yet knowing how to do that better ;) I consider to be it an interesting exersice, especially for the beginners with C#/.NET.

5. Quick sort basic implementaion

6. Summing array values. 

7. Returning absolute value.
